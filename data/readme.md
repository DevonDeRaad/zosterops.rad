This folder contains the genetic data needed to reproduce the results from this manuscript.
* The file called 'zost.unfiltered.snps.vcf.bz2' contains all unfiltered SNPs. The file had to be 'bzipped' for additional compression in order to get it under GitHub's 100Mb file size limit. It can be decompressed with the command 'bzip2 -d zost.unfiltered.snps.vcf.bz2'.
* The file called 'filtered.snps.vcf.gz' contains the filtered SNP dataset in standard gzip form (i.e., can be unzipped via 'gunzip filtered.snps.vcf.gz')
* The file called 'filtered.unlinked.snps.vcf.gz' contains the filtered, unlinked SNP dataset.
